While there isn't a centralized database specifically dedicated to consumer complaints 
about umbrellas, common issues reported in public product reviews include:

1. Durability: Many consumers complain about umbrellas breaking or malfunctioning after 
minimal use, such as the ribs bending or snapping in strong winds.

2. Ineffective Waterproofing: Some umbrellas fail to repel water effectively, leading to 
leakage or saturation during rain showers.

3. Compactness and Portability: Consumers often find that compact umbrellas are not as 
small or lightweight as advertised, making them inconvenient to carry around.

4. Difficulty Opening and Closing**: Certain umbrellas have mechanisms that are difficult 
to operate, causing frustration when opening or closing them, especially during sudden rainstorms.

5. Poor Wind Resistance: Umbrellas that are advertised as windproof may fail to withstand 
strong gusts, leading to inversion or damage.

6. Quality of Materials: Complaints may arise regarding the overall quality of materials 
used, such as flimsy fabric or handles breaking easily.

7. Lack of UV Protection: Some consumers expect umbrellas to provide protection from UV rays, 
especially those marketed for sun protection, but find them ineffective in this regard.

8. Design Flaws: Issues like uneven weight distribution, awkward handles, or inadequate 
coverage are often mentioned in reviews as design flaws that diminish the umbrella's usability.

9. Customer Service: Complaints may extend to poor customer service experiences, such as difficulty 
obtaining refunds or replacements for defective products.

10. Price vs. Quality: Many consumers express dissatisfaction when they perceive that the umbrella's 
price does not align with its quality or durability.

These complaints can vary depending on the brand, model, and specific features of the umbrella 
in question. Additionally, regional factors such as climate and weather conditions may influence
the prevalence of certain complaints.

### Follow-up Prompt 1

```
Among these top consumer complaints, what are the top three that we should address if we were to 
create a new umbrella?
```

Prompt Engineering Tips:

1. ChatGPT is able to answer follow-up questions based on previous conversations
2. Some previously mentioned details can be omitted
3. A ranking criteria can be specified

ChatGPT Response:

To prioritize the top three consumer complaints when creating a new umbrella, consider addressing 
the following issues:

1. Durability: Ensuring the umbrella is robust and able to withstand typical environmental 
conditions is crucial. This involves using high-quality materials for the frame, ribs, 
and canopy. Reinforcing weak points and conducting rigorous testing for durability, especially 
in windy conditions, can help prevent issues like bending or breaking.

2. Compactness and Portability: Consumers value umbrellas that are easy to carry around, 
particularly in unpredictable weather. Designing a compact and lightweight umbrella that folds 
down to a small size for convenient storage in bags, pockets, or car compartments can enhance 
its appeal. Streamlining the design without sacrificing durability can improve portability.

3. Effective Waterproofing: Providing reliable protection from rain is fundamental for any 
umbrella. Using waterproof materials for the canopy and ensuring seams are securely sealed 
can prevent leakage. Additionally, incorporating features like a water-repellent coating or 
quick-drying fabric can enhance the umbrella's performance in wet conditions.

By addressing these top consumer complaints in the development of a new umbrella, you can 
enhance its overall quality, usability, and customer satisfaction.

### Follow-up Prompt 2

```
Can you elaborate more on durability?
```

Prompt Engineering Tips:

1. Build on previous conversations
2. You may ask about anything mentioned in previous questions and responses


ChatGPT Response:

```
Certainly! When addressing durability concerns in the development of a new umbrella, several 
factors should be considered:

1. Materials Selection: Choose high-quality materials for key components such as the frame, 
ribs, canopy, and handle. For example, frames made from sturdy materials like fiberglass or 
reinforced aluminum are more durable than flimsy plastic frames. Similarly, canopies constructed 
from strong, waterproof fabrics like polyester or nylon are essential for longevity.

2. Frame Reinforcement: Reinforce critical points of the frame and ribs to withstand stress 
and pressure, particularly in windy conditions. This may involve using double-reinforced ribs 
or additional support struts to prevent bending or snapping.

3. Wind Resistance Testing: Conduct thorough wind resistance testing during the design phase 
to identify potential weak spots and make necessary adjustments. Testing in various wind conditions, 
including gusts, can help ensure the umbrella can withstand typical weather conditions without damage.

4. Quality Control: Implement strict quality control measures during manufacturing to maintain 
consistent standards and identify any defects or flaws early in the production process. This includes 
inspecting materials, components, and finished products to ensure they meet durability requirements.

5. Warranty and Customer Support: Offer a warranty or guarantee that demonstrates confidence in 
the umbrella's durability and provides assurance to customers. Additionally, establish responsive 
customer support channels to address any durability issues that arise post-purchase, such as providing 
timely replacements or repairs.

6. User Feedback Incorporation: Gather feedback from users through product testing, reviews, and 
surveys to identify areas for improvement related to durability. Incorporating real-world experiences 
and insights into the design process can help create a more durable and reliable umbrella.

By prioritizing durability in material selection, design, testing, quality control, and customer 
support, you can create a new umbrella that meets consumer expectations for longevity and withstands 
the rigors of everyday use, including adverse weather conditions.
