## Prompt 1.5 (Analyze a Hypothetical Scenario)

```
Analyze a hypothetical impactful scenario in details and include helpful visualizations.
```

### ChatGPT Response

```
Let's analyze a hypothetical impactful scenario for the umbrella venture where we face a 
significant increase in raw material costs. This is a realistic concern for any 
manufacturing business, especially one relying on potentially high-tech materials for an 
innovative product like a smart umbrella.

### Scenario Description: Increase in Raw Material Costs
Suppose raw material costs increase by 30% due to global supply chain disruptions. This 
scenario would directly affect the cost of goods sold (COGS) and could lead to 
adjustments in pricing strategies, ultimately impacting profitability and market 
competitiveness.

### Key Assumptions:
- Current COGS per unit: $20
- Increase: 30%
- New COGS per unit: $20 + (30% of $20) = $26
- Sales volume: Follows the previous forecast without changes (assuming demand elasticity 
is low in the short term).
- Other costs and revenues: Remain as previously forecasted.

### Objectives:
- Understand the impact on gross and operating profits.
- Explore adjustments in pricing to maintain margins without losing competitive edge.
- Assess the break-even point with new COGS and potential new pricing.

### Revised Financial Analysis with Increased COGS
We will recalculate the financial overview, adjusting only the COGS per unit, and then 
explore options for adjusting the selling price to mitigate the impact.

Let's start by recalculating the financials under this scenario.
```
![Financial Overview (Recalculated)](/New-Venture-Creation-with-ChatGPT/assets/images/financial1d5d1.png)
```
The visualization highlights the impact of a 30% increase in raw material costs on the 
financial performance of the umbrella venture over the first three years:

### Key Findings:

- Gross Profit: There's a noticeable decrease in gross profit across all years due to the 
increased cost of goods sold (COGS). This reduction illustrates how sensitive the 
business's profitability is to fluctuations in material costs.
  
- Operating Profit: Similarly, the operating profit is adversely affected. The decrease 
is proportionate to the gross profit reduction, reinforcing the importance of managing 
production costs in maintaining overall profitability.

### Exploring Price Adjustment:
Given the impact on profitability, the venture might consider adjusting its selling price 
to mitigate the effects of the increased COGS. Let's calculate the new selling price 
required to maintain the original gross profit margin.

#### Calculation:
- Original Gross Margin = \( \frac{\text{Original Gross Profit in Year 1}}{\text{Total 
Revenue in Year 1}} \)
- Required Selling Price to maintain this margin with increased COGS.
```
![Financial Overview (Recalculated 2)](/New-Venture-Creation-with-ChatGPT/assets/images/financial1d5d2.png)
```
To maintain the original gross profit margin after the 30% increase in raw material 
costs, the new selling price per unit would need to be approximately $42.77, compared to 
the original $50. This adjustment would help offset the increased production costs while 
attempting to preserve profitability.

### Updated Financial Performance with Adjusted Selling Price:

- Gross Profit: The adjusted selling price helps recover the gross profit close to the 
original levels, minimizing the impact of increased COGS.

- Operating Profit: Similarly, the operating profit sees improvement with the new selling 
price, though not completely restored to original projections, indicating some residual 
impact from increased costs.

This scenario highlights the importance of having a flexible pricing strategy that can 
adapt to fluctuating cost conditions. It also underscores the need for continuous 
monitoring of cost drivers and market conditions to maintain profitability and 
competitive positioning. 

Adjusting the price may also affect market demand, which should be evaluated through 
market testing or elasticity studies. Would you like to explore any additional scenarios 
or further aspects of this financial model?
