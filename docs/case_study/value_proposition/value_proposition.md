# Value Proposition / Brand Perception
{: .fs-9 }

{: .no_toc }


The value proposition is a clear statement that explains how a product or service solves 
customers' problems or improves their situation, delivers specific benefits, and tells 
the ideal customer why they should buy from this company and not from the competition. 
Building brand perception is about managing how customers perceive the brand's value 
based on their interactions and communications.
