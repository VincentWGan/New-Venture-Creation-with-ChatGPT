To prioritize the top three consumer complaints when creating a new umbrella, consider 
addressing the following issues:

1. Durability: Ensuring the umbrella is robust and able to withstand typical environmental 
conditions is crucial. This involves using high-quality materials for the frame, ribs, 
and canopy. Reinforcing weak points and conducting rigorous testing for durability, 
especially in windy conditions, can help prevent issues like bending or breaking.

2. Compactness and Portability: Consumers value umbrellas that are easy to carry around, 
particularly in unpredictable weather. Designing a compact and lightweight umbrella that 
folds down to a small size for convenient storage in bags, pockets, or car compartments 
can enhance its appeal. Streamlining the design without sacrificing durability can 
improve portability.

3. Effective Waterproofing: Providing reliable protection from rain is fundamental for 
any umbrella. Using waterproof materials for the canopy and ensuring seams are securely 
sealed can prevent leakage. Additionally, incorporating features like a water-repellent 
coating or quick-drying fabric can enhance the umbrella's performance in wet conditions.

By addressing these top consumer complaints in the development of a new umbrella, you can
enhance its overall quality, usability, and customer satisfaction.
