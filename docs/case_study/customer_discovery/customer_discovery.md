# Customer Discovery
{: .fs-9 }

{: .no_toc }


Customer discovery is the process of testing the hypotheses about your business and its 
potential clients. Businesses engage with potential customers to understand their 
requirements, validate the product-market fit, and gain insights into customer 
preferences, behavior, and the problems they face which the product or service aims to 
solve.
